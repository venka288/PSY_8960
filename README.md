#loc_pathways

This is a repository for a project examining how locus of control changes over time across different college major pathways. The purpose of this project is to understand the role agency and feelings of control affect academic decision-making.

The project contains four folders: Archives, Code, Data, and Reports. The Archives folder contains code for a boxplot of changes in locus of control by major pathway. The Code folder contains code for the simulated data. The Data folder contains a data dictionary and the simulated data file. The reports folder contains the report code as an Rmd file, the full report exported as a pdf and tex file, as well as files with references.
